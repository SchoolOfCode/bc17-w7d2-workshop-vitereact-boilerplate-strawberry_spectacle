Start by adding your code to the default component (App), it's in "./src/App.jsx"

Once you've cloned the starter application and got it running - go to localhost (and the right port ðŸ˜‰) and check out the default component, pretty cool right! Now it's time to start moving your code in.

 The initial goal is to just move across the HTML and CSS from your landing page repo into one big React component in the new React application.

 Then move the HTML and CSS for the next part of the page then check its working and looking like you expect. Rinse and repeat until the whole landing page has been moved across. Now you have a single large component.
